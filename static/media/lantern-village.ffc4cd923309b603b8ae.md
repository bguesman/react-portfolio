While in college, I worked on designing the interactive light installation "Lantern Village" with Brown STEAM (STEM + Art). In addition to working on the lanterns themselves, I composed a piece to accompany the experience.

<div class="soundcloud-wrapper" style="height:300px;">
    <iframe class="empty" width="100%" height="100" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1316609980&color=%2306050b&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>
</div>

The installation itself had a sort of clean, mystical aesthetic. The score had to mirror this, but also not be too intrusive, to avoid distracting from the experience of interacting with the lanterns.

I took some inspiration from Solar Fields' score for the original Mirror's Edge game, but tried to push it in a more ambient direction. No percussion elements were used directly---instead the rhythm was implied via automation, delay trails, and one or two tonal instruments playing in tempo.

This project is around 5 years old at this point. If I were to go back, there are some mix inconsistencies I would sort out.
