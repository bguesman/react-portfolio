Some time in 2020, I collaborated on a song, _Prepared To Be Bored_, for the Funnybone and Friends benefit compilation, _Room For You_. I provided guitar work and some light production elements, plus gave some advice on arranging.

Most of the guitar sounds were recorded on a strat through a modded RAT, into a Princeton Reverb. The pickup was practically up against the amp's grill cloth to get out of control feedback reminiscent of Sonic Youth's guitar sounds.
