SN0WCRASH is a solo indie music project that got started when I was 18, back in 2016, making music in my childhood bedroom. Since then, I've released 3 EP's and one full length record under the alias, with a short stint playing some of the songs with my band in college, Megafauna.

### Everything Will Happen
#### 2021

The most recent SN0WCRASH project is a full-length record I worked on with [Luke Ellingson (aka Noah Silvestry)](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3g8Gpwkqi13zbFyw9ibYWj?si=bOm9PwTdQsqr1eFX4xkb8w), [Language Please](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5gbFnBc2TKWfUWmZzw5PrP?si=B_R6JzNvS42shqMqgoLOSg), and [Demos](https://open.spotify.com/artist/33Qp3UjeMxBBKpw7Aalp9v?si=940f2e4cc28f4d34).

These songs explore a rawer, less electronic instrumentation, and a looser sort of songwriting. The record also tells a story from start to finish, and in that way is something of a concept album.

### U. V. Captcha
#### 2016

The first SN0WCRASH project was a collection of songs I wrote and produced right before I went to college. 

Equipped with my telecaster, my Akai keyboard, and Logic Pro X's built-in bitcrusher, the EP is decidedly indie-electronic. Topically, the songs revolve around identity and alienation in an increasingly digital world.

### Don't Get Your Hopes Up
#### 2019

This EP was written and recorded over the summer of 2019, when I was living in Madison, Wisconsin. [Jamie Atschinow](https://soundcloud.com/jamie-ats?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) provided vocals and vocal arrangement work.

The song topics gravitate toward loneliness and regret. Palette-wise, the instrumentation is further in the synth-wave direction; the synths and melodies have an 80's alternative tinge.

### Singularity
#### 2017

I worked on this EP in my dorm a freshman in college, and then through the summer afterward while I was back in California.

Coming off of working on U. V. Captcha, this EP is significantly more electronic, and less indie-disco. It's darker, but still very pop-forward, with lyrics that are more personal and less concept-driven.
