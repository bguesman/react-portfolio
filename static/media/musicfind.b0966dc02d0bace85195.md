Myself and [David Schurman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dschurman) (a friend from Brown who is now co-founder of the agribusiness startup Cloud Agronomics) were both frustrated with the lack of visual music discovery tools out there. After searching for a virtual "music map" of sorts, we were disappointed with the results. Most maps either only went one relational level deep or—even worse—were text based!

We realized that, in order for a related artists graph to be meaningful, two layers of depth are necessary, and relations between artists that are not the center artist have to be represented. This (literally) ties together artists who are similar to each other.

This is particularly useful for seeing what different genres artists draw from. For instance, if you search "BØRNS" on Musicfind, you'll see two groups form. One has artists from the early 2010's who produce really polished, poppy indie rock, like Bleachers and WALK THE MOON. Another is populated with female-dominant indie pop groups, like Banks, Broods, and Wet. These arguably represent two different important facets of BØRNS' musical style and influence.

It's been around two and a half years since I worked on this project, and due to the rapidly changing nature of web libraries, it is undergoing the modern digital equivalent of erosion. Please forgive any bugs you stumble upon!

This project lives on the web! You can find it [here](https://accounts.spotify.com/en/authorize?client_id=47c6369ae4194f96a070658bc5471db5&redirect_uri=https:%2F%2Fbrowncybersteam.github.io%2Frelated-artists-graph%2Fmusic-find.html&response_type=token&state=123).
