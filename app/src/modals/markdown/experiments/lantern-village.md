As project leaders for Brown cyberSTEAM (STEM + Art), Eddie Jiao and I organized students from Brown and RISD to build an interactive art installation.

Each lantern is a meter tall and uses ultrasonic and sound sensors to change color depending on human presence and environmental sound. All the firmware written to run on arduino mega'sâ€”each lantern needed quite a few PWM's to drive the LED strips! The housings for each lantern were 3D printed from masonite.
