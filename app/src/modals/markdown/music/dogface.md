While in college, someone reached out to me to score a portion of the Brown Motion Pictures short film, _Dogface_. The lead character, a roadside sign-spinner by day, moonlights as the frontman in a punk band.

The film deals with mid-20's ennui, and the score needed to mirror that sort of frustrated longing. The director was inspired by mid-2000's pop punk, songs like Third Eye Blind's _Semi-Charmed Life_.

Ultimately, we felt the need to modernize it slightly, so the final result split the difference between that genre and a more recent grunge/post-punk sound. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World's score, written by Beck, was a big influence from a sonic perspective, though the song-writing remained solidly in the Green Day idiom.
